/**
 * Metadata description of the application menu of the {@link JRibbon}
 * component. The ribbon application menu has three parts:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * +-------------------------------------+
 * |           |                         |
 * |           |                         |
 * |  primary  |        secondary        |
 * |   area    |           area          |        
 * |           |                         |
 * |           |                         |
 * |-------------------------------------|
 * |            footer area              |
 * +-------------------------------------+
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The entries in the primary area are always visible. The secondary area
 * entries are shown based on the currently active element in the primary area.
 * There are three different types of primary entries:
 * </p>
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>Associated {@link ActionListener} passed to the constructor of the
 * {@link RibbonApplicationMenuEntryPrimary}. When this entry is armed (with
 * mouse rollover or via keyboard navigation), the contents of the secondary
 * area are cleared. The <code>Quit</code> menu item is an example of such a
 * primary menu entry.</li>
 * <li>Associated {@link PrimaryRolloverCallback} set by the
 * {@link RibbonApplicationMenuEntryPrimary#setRolloverCallback(PrimaryRolloverCallback)}
 * . When this entry is armed (with mouse rollover or via keyboard navigation),
 * the contents of the secondary area are populated by the application callback
 * implementation of
 * {@link PrimaryRolloverCallback#menuEntryActivated(javax.swing.JPanel)}. The
 * <code>Open</code> menu item is an example of such a primary menu entry,
 * showing a list of recently opened files.</li>
 * <li>Associated list of {@link RibbonApplicationMenuEntrySecondary}s added
 * with the
 * {@link RibbonApplicationMenuEntryPrimary#addSecondaryMenuGroup(String, RibbonApplicationMenuEntrySecondary...)}
 * API. When this entry is armed (with mouse rollover or via keyboard
 * navigation), the secondary area shows menu buttons for the registered
 * secondary menu entries. The <code>Save As</code> menu item is an example of
 * such a primary menu item, showing a list of default save formats.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>
 * At runtime, the application menu entries are implemented as
 * {@link JCommandMenuButton}, but the application code does not operate on that
 * level. Instead, the application code creates metadata-driven description of
 * the ribbon application menu, and that description is used to create and
 * populate the "real" controls of the application menu popup.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Note that once a {@link RibbonApplicationMenu} is set on the {@link JRibbon}
 * with the {@link JRibbon#setApplicationMenu(RibbonApplicationMenu)}, its
 * contents cannot be changed. An {@link IllegalStateException} will be thrown
 * from {@link #addMenuEntry(RibbonApplicationMenuEntryPrimary)} and
 * {@link #addFooterEntry(RibbonApplicationMenuEntryFooter)}.
 * </p>
